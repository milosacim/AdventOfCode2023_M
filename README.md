# AdventOfCode2023_M
My attempt to solve Advent Of Code challenges but using Power Query M language.

How it works:

Step 1. Import input.txt in your PowerBI file.
Step 2. Create new Blank Query
Step 3. In Advanced Editor paste the code for one day.

Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each day.

Kinda works I guess. :)
