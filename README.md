# AdventOfCode2023_M
My attempt to solve Advent Of Code challenges but using Power Query M language.<br />
<br />
How it works:<br />
<br />
Step 1. Import input.txt in your PowerBI file.<br />
Step 2. Create new Blank Query<br />
Step 3. In Advanced Editor paste the code for one day.<br />
<br />
Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each day.<br />
<br />
Kinda works I guess. :)<br />
